# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players alternate turns as "O" and "X", and the game highlights the winning player with a message in the center. Players can reset the game at any time.

## Features

- **Two Players**: Player 1 is "O" and Player 2 is "X".
- **Dynamic Background Color**: Each tile changes color based on the player's symbol (`O` is red, `X` is green).
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects a win pattern and displays the winning player's symbol.
- **Reset Functionality**: Players can reset the board to play a new game.

## Game Rules

1. **Objective**: Get three of your symbols (`O` or `X`) in a row, column, or diagonal.
2. **Turns**: Player "O" goes first, followed by Player "X".
3. **Winning**: The first player to align three of their symbols wins.
4. **Reset**: Press the reset button to clear the board and start a new game.
